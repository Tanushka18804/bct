Create and deploy a Solidity smart contract that stores and displays student data on a blockchain test network using Remix IDE.


---

🧠 Concept

You’ll write a smart contract that:

Defines a structure (struct) for student data

Allows adding new student details

Lets anyone view the stored student data

(Optionally) allows multiple students to be stored using an array or mapping

🖥️ Step-by-Step Procedure

Step 1: Open Remix IDE

Visit 👉 https://remix.ethereum.org

Create a new workspace or use the default one.

Inside the contracts folder, create a new file called Student.sol.



---

Step 2: Write the Smart Contract Code

Paste the following Solidity code:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.8;

contract StudentData {
    
    struct Student {
        uint256 rollNo;
        string name;
        string department;
        uint256 marks;
    }

    Student public student;

    // Function to set student details
    function setStudentData(uint256 _rollNo, string memory _name, string memory _department, uint256 _marks) public {
        student = Student(_rollNo, _name, _department, _marks);
    }

    // Function to get student details
    function getStudentData() public view returns (uint256, string memory, string memory, uint256) {
        return (student.rollNo, student.name, student.department, student.marks);
    }
}


---

Step 3: Compile the Contract

1. Click on the Solidity Compiler icon (⚙️).


2. Choose version 0.8.8.


3. Click Compile Student.sol.


4. Ensure no syntax errors appear.




---

Step 4: Deploy the Contract

1. Go to the Deploy & Run Transactions tab (💠 icon).


2. Set Environment to:

Remix VM (London) for local testing, or

Injected Provider - MetaMask for deploying to a test network (like Sepolia).



3. Click Deploy.


4. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask (if using a test network).




---

Step 5: Interact with the Contract

After deployment, expand the Deployed Contracts section.

You’ll see:

setStudentData

getStudentData

student (auto getter for public variable)


Now:

1. In setStudentData, enter:

101, "Tanushka", "Computer", 89

Then click transact.


2. Once done, click getStudentData → it should return the same values you entered.

Optional Enhancement (for multiple students)

If you want to store many students instead of just one, use an array or mapping:

pragma solidity ^0.8.8;

contract StudentRecords {
    struct Student {
        uint256 rollNo;
        string name;
        string department;
        uint256 marks;
    }

    Student[] public students;

    function addStudent(uint256 _rollNo, string memory _name, string memory _department, uint256 _marks) public {
        students.push(Student(_rollNo, _name, _department, _marks));
    }

    function getStudent(uint256 index) public view returns (uint256, string memory, string memory, uint256) {
        Student memory s = students[index];
        return (s.rollNo, s.name, s.department, s.marks);
    }
}

Step 6: View Transactions & Gas Values

The video likely shows how to view:

Transaction cost and Gas used after each transaction.

This info appears in Remix under the terminal panel after you execute a function.



---

✅ Output

After completion:

You can store and retrieve student details using blockchain transactions.

Every change is recorded on-chain and viewable on Remix or Etherscan (if deployed to a testnet).

Would you like me to extend this to Assignment 4 (if the next one in the playlist) or also explain how to check gas cost and transaction hash in Remix like shown in the video?
