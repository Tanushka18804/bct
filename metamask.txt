Step 5: Secure Your Wallet – Secret Recovery Phrase

1. MetaMask will display a 12-word Secret Recovery Phrase (very important 🔒).


2. Write it down carefully on paper and store it safely (do NOT share it online).


3. You’ll be asked to confirm the recovery phrase by selecting the words in the correct order.

Step 6: Wallet Dashboard

Once setup is complete, you’ll see your wallet interface showing:

Account Name (e.g., Account 1)

Ethereum Mainnet as the default network

Wallet Balance ($0 initially)

Buttons for Buy, Send, Swap, and Receive



---

Step 7: Add Test Network (Optional but often required for SPPU practical)

1. Click the network dropdown at the top (where it says “Ethereum Mainnet”).


2. Click “Show/hide test networks”.


3. Enable “Sepolia test network” or “Goerli test network.”


4. Now you can switch to that network for experimenting with test Ether.

Step 8: Verify Installation

Check that your MetaMask wallet address (starts with 0x...) is visible.

You can copy it using the Copy icon.

This confirms your wallet is successfully installed and functional.
